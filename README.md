# Matching

This is an application to `Beat Matching`.

It can only run on `Windows`.

There is a sample.

If you don't know, you can open the `cmd` and change the path to the application's path.

Then, input `compare r test1 test2`.

## The way to use:
- Dowload
- Use:
  `[The path you dowload it + compare] [Random] [Right program] [The program to test]`
  
  For example:
  
  `C:\compare D:\random.exe D:\AC.exe D:\test.exe`
 
- The things to notice:
  - Please make sure the `random` can build a file as the data.
  - Make sure the `Right program` and `The program to test` can read from the file.
